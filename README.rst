miniHMM
=======

This is a toy library that implements first-order homogeneous hidden Markov models. 
I have found it useful for a number of pet projects, but I am in the process of 
refactoring and rewriting substantial pieces of it, so it should not be considered
remotely stable by anybody who happens upon it.

Cheers,
Josh
