This is a toy library that implements first-order homogeneous hidden Markov
models.  I have found it useful for a number of pet projects, but I am in the
process of factoring it out of another project and simultaneously rewriting
substantial pieces of it, so it should not be considered remotely stable by
anybody who happens upon it. In fact, it just *might* be broken right now!

Things to look forward to in the future:

 - More robust / completely redesigned unit tests
 - better serialization/storage of models
 - high order models!
 - non-hidden Markov models

Cheers,
Josh
